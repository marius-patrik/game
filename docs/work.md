# Work

Single source of truth for what's being done, what's next, and what's parked.

**Rule for the overseer picking this up cold:** if **Now** is empty, take the top of **Next**, draft a plan in `docs/plans/`, then dispatch an execution (or specialist) agent. Do not stop for permission — the scope is already agreed in the linked issue. If **Next** is empty, run the `maintenance` skill before asking the user.

**Rule for an execution agent:** the overseer assigns you exactly one issue + branch. Do not pick from this file — the overseer dispatches.

## Now

_Nothing in flight._ Alpha-playable milestone shipped.

## Next

_Next is empty — pick from Backlog or run `maintenance`._

## Backlog

- [ ] Admin live-sessions view — cross-reference DB users with live Colyseus clients.
- [ ] Persisted skill cooldowns across zone swap (currently in-memory per-room).
- [ ] More skills + per-class skill trees (warrior/mage/rogue).
- [ ] Boss mob mechanics — phases, telegraphed AOEs, enrage timer.
- [ ] Chat persistence + moderation — DB-backed history, profanity filter, DMs.
- [ ] Gated portals + cinematic transition.
- [ ] Tooltips on item icons (show bonuses on hover).
- [ ] Mobile-specific equip/use tap UX polish.
- [ ] Guild/party system.
